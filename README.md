# printf
My second project in a ["school 42"](https://42.fr/en/homepage/).

For the ft_printf project of the 42 school cursus, we must recreate the famous C library printf function. This project teaches us about variadic arguments as well as structures if we plan to implement printf's extra flags.

- Supported conversions: %, c, s, p, i, d, u, x, X
